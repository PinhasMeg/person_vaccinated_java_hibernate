# vaccinated_person_java_hibernate

In this demo project we can see for the back-end the connexion between java spring boot
and hibernate to a postgres database.

The Backend's code is distributed according to layers: controller service repository and domain class.
The architecture is: personController -> personService -> personRepository.
The domain class is the Person class.

The Frontend's code is writed with angular 8 and I used  DevExtreme, the set of enterprise-ready UI component suites for Angular(and React etc..).
