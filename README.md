# person_vaccinated_java_hibernate

In this demo project we can see the connexion between java spring boot
and hibernate to a postgres database.
The code is distributed according to layers: controller and Person class.
In the next time I will add the service layer and the dto layer(to separate the
connexion to the database and the client side).
